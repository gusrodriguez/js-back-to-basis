# js-back-to-basis

## What's this?
If you like reinventing the wheel :wheel_of_dharma: this is your place. This is a project to build stuff in vanilla js in order to go back to basics and re-implement basic concepts. 

## Are you kidding? :clown_face:
I am. This is not what you should do in real life, so don't try this at home. This is only to review concepts that sometimes are forgotten because of the continuous use of third party libraries. Sometimes is useful to go back to basis and take another look at the weird parts of Javascript.
